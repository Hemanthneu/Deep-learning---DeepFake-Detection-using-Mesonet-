# Deep-learning---DeepFake-Detection-using-Mesonet-
Developed a deep learning model using the MesoNet convolutional neural network in order to identify deepfake images with high accuracy. Employed the MesoNet-4 architecture along with inverted residual blocks and an attention mechanism to enable the model to focus on the most important features of the image at a mesoscopic level, and trained the model on a custom dataset of 150K high-resolution images generated by StyleGAN and Adobe Photoshop. Utilized global unstructured pruning with a sparsity of 20% on the model in order to make it lighter, and thereby increased the model's accuracy to 97%.
