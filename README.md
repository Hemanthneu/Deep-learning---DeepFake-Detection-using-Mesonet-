# Deep-learning-DeepFake-Detection-using-Mesonet-
Engineered an advanced deep learning model leveraging the MesoNet convolutional neural network, specifically designed to detect deepfake images with exceptional accuracy. Innovatively incorporated the MesoNet-4 architecture, enhanced with inverted residual blocks and a sophisticated attention mechanism, enabling acute focus on critical mesoscopic image features. The model was meticulously trained on a diverse, custom-compiled dataset comprising 150K high-resolution images, intricately generated using cutting-edge StyleGAN and Adobe Photoshop techniques. Further optimized the model's performance and efficiency through strategic implementation of global unstructured pruning, achieving a 20% sparsity level. This pivotal optimization not only streamlined the model's complexity but also significantly boosted its accuracy to an impressive 97%, marking a substantial advancement in deepfake detection technology

# MesoNet CNN:
MesoNet is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for the detection of deepfake videos and images. The term "Meso" refers to its focus on mesoscopic properties of images. Unlike other deep learning models that either focus on macro features (like the overall image structure) or micro features (like textures and individual pixels), MesoNet targets the mesoscopic level, which is somewhere in between. This approach makes it particularly effective in identifying deepfakes, as it can capture inconsistencies or anomalies that are not easily visible at the macro or micro levels.

*Key aspects of MesoNet include:

Simplified Architecture: MesoNet typically has a simpler architecture compared to other deep learning models used in image processing, making it faster and more efficient.
Specialized for Deepfakes: It is adept at identifying the subtle anomalies introduced during the deepfake generation process, especially in the intermediate features of images.


# StyleGAN:
StyleGAN, developed by NVIDIA, is a type of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) known for creating highly realistic and high-resolution images, particularly human faces. GANs consist of two parts: a generator that creates images and a discriminator that evaluates them. StyleGAN introduces several innovations that improve the quality and control of the generated images:

Style-Based Generator: Unlike traditional GANs, StyleGAN uses a style-based generator that allows fine control over various aspects of the generated image, like facial features, expressions, and even lighting conditions.

Improved Quality: The images generated by StyleGAN are notable for their high resolution and remarkable realism, making it a powerful tool in the field of synthetic image generation.

Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN): StyleGAN uses AdaIN layers at each level of the generatorâ€™s network to separately control different aspects of the image, contributing to its ability to produce diverse and realistic images.

StyleGAN has become popular in areas like computer graphics, art, and design. However, it also poses challenges in terms of deepfake generation, as it can create highly convincing fake images that are difficult to distinguish from real ones.
